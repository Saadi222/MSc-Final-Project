Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews using Machine Learning and Transformers
📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness of classical machine learning models and transformer-based deep learning models for sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. The goal is to automatically classify customer reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The project compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and DistilBERT under a consistent experimental framework, analysing their performance, generalisation ability, and practical applicability on real-world, noisy, and imbalanced textual data.

This repository contains the full pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and analysis.**
